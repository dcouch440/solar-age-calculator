## About Jest:
  ### This app:
  *  Jest is used in this app to test segregated sections of code to ensure things are working correctly.
  ### What is Jest?
  *  From [wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jest_(JavaScript_framework) ) : \
    "Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte."

## About Babel:
  #### This app:
  *  Babel is used in this application for jest imports.
  #### What is Babel?
  *  From [wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_(transcompiler) ) : \
    "Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines. Babel is a popular tool for using the newest features of the JavaScript programming language."
***
## About ESLint:
  #### This app:
  *    ESLint is used in this application to keep syntax in order.
  #### What is ESLint?
  *  From [wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESLint ) : \
    "ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It was created by Nicholas C. Zakas in 2013. Rules in ESLint are configurable, and customized rules can be defined and loaded. ESLint covers both code quality and coding style issues."
***
## About webpack:
  #### This app:
  * webpack is used in this application to bundle these technologies.
  #### What is webpack?
  *  From [wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webpack ) : \
    "webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules."
