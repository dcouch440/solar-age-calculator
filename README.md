About jest:
  jest is an open source testing package that builds off the idea of TDD. Jest uses deep equality to see if values are matched. A developer is the one making the test though so there is a high importance in being precise and modular.

About babel: 
  babel is used in this application for jest imports.

About eslint:
  eslint is used in this application to keep syntax in order.

About webpack:
  webpack is used in this application to bundle these technologies.
